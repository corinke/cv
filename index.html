    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I have worked on a multitude of mediums to make creative pieces, ranging from video to audio to graphic design. I have displayed some of my favourite projects below.</p>

<h2>Void - Radio drama</h2>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/320562944&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/corink" title="corink" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">corink</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/corink/void" title="Void" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Void</a></div>

<p>I created this radio drama as a final project in a third year radio module during my degree. It pieced together everything I had learned throughout the duration of my course to work on a solo 10 minute radio drama. I had written a script loosely based on a horror manga <em>Uzumaki</em> by Junji Ito, which was interesting to work with as I transformed a purely visual medium into audio, so I had to reimagine how the scary elements would transfer over. I had also hired actors, created foley by recording household sounds and manipulating them in Adobe Audition, and I edited the audio to the final piece hosted on SoundCloud. I received very positive feedback from my lecturers, where they pointed out it was professional standard.</p>

    <h2>Volunteering as a Graphic Designer</h2>

    <p>I worked as a volunteer graphic designer at a local charity, Film Oxford. The brief was to create print leaflets to warn about the dangers of wild swimming, as a counterpart to an educational video, to be distributed around local secondary schools. I had used Adobe InDesign to design the leaflet towards printing specifications, Illustrator to create graphics and used the video to create concise bullet points as the leaflet’s content. I understood the audience was school-aged children so the design was bold, attention-grabbing but not too childish. As a result of this, I received positive feedback from management and I was invited back for more graphics work.

    <h1>Achievements and Qualifications</h1>
    <h2>Salesforce Marketing Cloud Email Specialist</h2>
    <a href="Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud_Email_Specialist.jpg" target="_blank" alt="Marketing Cloud Email Specialist. Click to view larger image"><img src="Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud_Email_Specialist_sml.jpg" class="modal-img" alt="Marketing Cloud Email Specialist. Click to view larger image"></a>
    <p>I have used Marketing Cloud for a number of years, and I wanted to formally show my skills by taking the Email Specialist exam. This certification shows I can use the basics in email marketing along with some of the more advanced features such as Journey Builder and Automation Studio. </p>
    
    <h2>Salesforce Pardot Email Specialist</h2>
    <a href="Salesforce_Pardot_Specialist.jpg" target="_blank" alt="Pardot Email Specialist. Click to view larger image"><img src="Salesforce_Pardot_Specialist_sml.jpg" class="modal-img" alt="Pardot Email Specialist certificate. Click to view larger image"></a>
    <p>I have used Pardot for just over a year and I have also been an admin for most of that time. This certification covered the basics in email marketing along with advanced features such as Engagement Studio, automation rules and custom redirects. However, it did not cover some of the admin features that I used day to day. </p>

    <h2>Code First: Girls - Beginners HTML and CSS web development course</h2>
    <a href="Code first girls award.jpg" target="_blank" alt="Code First:Girls award. Click to view larger image "><img src="Code_first_girls_award_sml.jpg" class="modal-img" alt="Code First: Girls certificate. Click to view larger image"></a>
    <p>I applied for this course to improve my skills in web development, and won a place in the course as it would benefit my skill set in my job at the time. I had learnt these skills in college and university but I was still a bit rusty, and lacked best practice knowledge to build a fully functioning website with the correct markup. The course taught me the skills required to make a website such as this, which I found invaluable. </p>
