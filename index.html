 	<h2><i class="fas fa-building"></i>Volunteer Video Journalist - That's Oxfordshire TV </h2>
   <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>July 2016</h3>

 		<ul>
 			<li>Utilised research skills through discovering local news stories using complex searches
on search engines and local news websites.</li>
<li>Successfully organised video shoots in the studio and on location with clients. This was made possible through organised phone communication, and informed online communication.</li>
<li>Independently produced videos by working to tight deadlines. The productions were broadcast on television, so absolute precision and ability to work under pressure were key. This included writing interview scripts and recording voice overs.</li>
<li>Competently recorded news stories on location using industry standard equipment. This required creative flair to execute cutaway shots. Additionally, I also conducted interviews behind the camera, which required a high level of concentration and multi-tasking.</li>
