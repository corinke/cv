My CV

This project is to create an interactive one page website to showcase my CV. It allows me to make an attractive, more interactive CV to apply for jobs and to display my skills in web design and development.

The aim is to create all assets from scratch, and not to use out of the box plug ins like Bootstrap. This will help me futher my understanding of coding and how to achieve looks and features that may be easily achieved in Bootstrap, but I would rather know how to make them myself.

colour scheme:
/* Color Theme Swatches in Hex */
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-1-hex { color: #304269; }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-2-hex { color: #91BED4; }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-3-hex { color: #D9E8F5; }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-4-hex { color: #FFFFFF; }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-5-hex { color: #F26101; }

/* Color Theme Swatches in RGBA */
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-1-rgba { color: rgba(47, 66, 105, 1); }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-2-rgba { color: rgba(144, 189, 212, 1); }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-3-rgba { color: rgba(216, 232, 244, 1); }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-4-rgba { color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); }
.Corporate-Orange-&-Blue-5-rgba { color: rgba(242, 96, 1, 1); }


As this will always be a work in progress, heres a to-do list:

-   add accessibility for screen readers

-   JS module for the menu items to retain everything on one page

-   further adapt responsive screens on the page
